## Introduction

Intuitionistic mathematics can be structured into two levels.  The first level arises directly out
of Brouwer’s criticism of certain methods and notions of classical mathematics.  In particular the
notion of ‘truth’ that gives rise to the law of excluded middle was rejected and instead the meaning
of mathematical statements was to be based on the notion of ‘proof’.  While implicit in this first
level of intuitionism was a theory of meaning quite different from the classical one, it was
nevertheless the case that the body of mathematics that could be developed within this level
remained a part of classical mathematics.  Because Brouwer felt that mathematical analysis could not
be developed adequately on this basis he was led to formulate his own conception of the continuum.
This conception involved the mathematical treatment of incompletely specified objects such as free
choice sequences.  The second level of intuitionism builds on the first level but also includes
these radical ideas that turn out to be incompatible with classical mathematics.  Although
considerable effort has been made over the years to make these ideas more transparent they have
remained rather obscure to most mathematicians and the mathematics based on them has had a very
limited following.

Since Bishop’s book [[3]](#r3){#rr3 .rr} appeared, it has become clear that, in spite of Brouwer’s
views, constructive analysis can be developed perfectly adequately while staying within the first
level of intuitionism.  This fact has led to a renewed interest in this part of intuitionism.  The
desire has been to find an analogue, for Bishop’s constructive mathematics, of the generally
accepted formal system ZF for classical mathematics.  Several approaches have been tried and there
has been some controversy over their relative merits.  Two such approaches are ‘Constructive Set
Theory’ (see [[7]](#r7){#rr7 .rr} and [[13]](#r13){#rr13 .rr}) and ‘Intuitionistic Type Theory’ (see
[[11]](#r11){#rr11 .rr}).  In this paper we take the view that these, and perhaps other approaches,
are not necessarily in conflict with each other.  Constructive set theory suppresses all explicit
constructive notions in order to be as familiar as possible to the classical mathematician.  On the
other hand type theory aims to give a rigorous foundation for the primitive notions of constructive
mathematics.

The appeal of Bishop’s book is that it wastes little time on the analysis of constructive concepts
but instead develops analysis in a language mostly familiar to the classical mathematician.  In
constructive set theory this is taken a stage further.  As in ZF there are just the notions of set
and set membership with an axiom system that is a subsystem of ZF using intuitionistic logic, and
including the axiom of extensionality.  In such a system the direct constructive content of Bishop’s
notions has been lost and there arises the crucial question:  What is the constructive meaning of
the notion of set used in constructive set theory?  We aim to answer that question in this paper.
What is needed is a rigorous framework in which the primitive notions of constructive mathematics
are directly displayed, together with a natural interpretation of constructive set theory in that
framework.  We shall give such a framework based on the intuitionistic type theory of
[[11]](#r11){#rr11-1 .rr}.  We could have taken instead a system of ‘Explicit Mathematics’ (see
[[5]](#r5){#rr5 .rr} and [[2]](#r2){#rr2 .rr}).  But systems of explicit mathematics leave the
logical notions unanalysed, whereas type theory is a logic free theory of constructions within which
the logical notions can be defined.  For this reason we consider type theory to be more fundamental.

The axiom system CZF (Constructive ZF) is set out in §1 and some elementary properties are given in
§2.  The system is closely related to the systems considered by Myhill and Friedman in their papers.
In §3 we summarise the type-theoretic notions of [[11]](#r11){#rr11-2 .rr} and introduce the type of
sets.  The interpretation of CZF is set up in §4 and its correctness is proved in §5 and §6.
Finally in §7 we consider a new principle of choice for constructive set theory.

Formally, the type of sets was first introduced by Leversha in [[10]](#r10){#rr10 .rr} where it was
used to give a complicated type-theoretic interpretation of Myhill’s original formulation of
constructive set theory in [[13]](#r13){#rr13-1 .rr}.  Unfortunately it was not realised at that
time that the type itself gave a constructive notion of set.  Instead it was only used as an
appropriate constructive notion of ordinal to use in indexing the stages of Leversha’s construction.


## 1.  The axiom system CZF

We formulate CZF in a first order language $\mathcal{L}$ having the logical primitives $\bot,$ $∨,$
$∧,$ $→,$ $∀x,$ $∃x,$, the restricted quantifiers $(∀x∈y),$ $(∃x∈y)$ and the binary relation
symbols $∈$ and $=.$  We assume a standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic logic.  The remaining
axioms of CZF are divided into two groups.

### Structural axioms

Defining schemes for the restricted quantifiers.

$$(∀x∈y)φ(x) ↔ ∀x(x∈y → φ(x))$$

$$(∃x∈y)φ(x) ↔ ∃x(x∈y ∧ φ(x))$$

Equality axioms.

$$x = y ↔ ∀z(z∈x ↔ z∈y)$$

$$x = y ∧ y∈z ↔ x∈z$$

Set induction scheme.

$$∀y ((∀x∈y)φ(x) → φ(y)) → ∀xφ(x)$$

### Set existence axioms

Pairing.

$$∃z(x∈z ∧ y∈z)$$

Union.

$$∃z(∀y∈x)(∀u∈y)(u∈z)$$

Restricted separation.
